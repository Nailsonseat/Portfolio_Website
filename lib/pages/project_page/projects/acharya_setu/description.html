    <p>My most ambitious project ever, This app aims to reduce a teacher's time in non teaching activities, since only 19% of a teachers time is actually sent on teaching. The app provides a huge set of features to manipulate and create questions at the click of a button. This Cross platform application gets many birds with one stone.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Randomized questions for each and every student for a specific question template.</li>
        <li>Randomized question sets for a group of students, the user has the choice to divide the
            question set/bank in any number of sets, even one set of questions per student.
        </li>
        <li>Easy to maintain and shareable question banks.</li>
        <li>Uses GPT API to to generate, extend and segment questions on a click of a button.</li>
    </ul>
