    <p>During the preparations for the internals, we had to present our idea to the experts from
        Navyug Navchar Foundation which is the incubation cell at IET Lucknow. And finally we came
        in first in the hackathon. I was the one who gave the presentation and our team 404 Founders
        came on top with 78.33 points.</p>
