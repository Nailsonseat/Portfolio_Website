  <h4>Below are the some of the prominent algorithms used in the app.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>The RSA algorithm - </b> It is an asymmetric cryptographic method that
      uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for
      decryption, based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime
      numbers. It ensures secure data transmission by allowing anyone to encrypt
      a message using the recipient's public key, which can only be decrypted by
      the recipient's private key.
    </li>
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <b>The Blowfish algorithm - </b> it is a symmetric key block cipher
      designed to provide fast and secure encryption, using a variable-length
      key from 32 bits to 448 bits, and operates on 64-bit blocks of data
      through a 16-round Feistel network. It is known for its speed and
      effectiveness, making it suitable for applications where encryption
      performance is critical.
    </li>
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <b>The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) - </b> It is a family of cryptographic
      hash functions designed to ensure data integrity by generating a
      fixed-size hash value from input data.
    </li>
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <b>Fingerprint authentication - </b> It is a biometric security method
      that verifies an individual's identity by comparing their fingerprint
      against a pre-stored fingerprint template. It ensures secure and
      convenient access control by using unique patterns of ridges and valleys
      on a person's fingertip, making it difficult to forge or duplicate.
    </li>
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <b>Flutter Secure Storage - </b> It is a Flutter plugin that provides a
      secure way to store key-value pairs on a mobile device. It leverages
      platform-specific secure storage mechanisms, such as iOS's Keychain and
      Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences, to protect sensitive data like
      tokens, passwords, and other credentials. This ensures that the stored
      data is encrypted and accessible only by the app, enhancing the security
      of mobile applications.
