      The inspiration for this mobile application was a really personal one, I
      have been a user of Dashlane password manager for a long time now and I
      have always been impressed by the security and the ease of use of the
      application. But lately its free tier has substantially reduced its free
      features to the point wheere I could not even add, copy or edit my
      passwords without a paid subscription. So I decided to make my own
      password vault called Vaulto.
