    The IIT Madras degree program's primary learning platform, the SEEK portal, serves as a
    comprehensive educational environment. It includes learning videos, assignments, resources,
    practice and graded assignments, and programming quizzes, all designed to support self-paced,
    self-scheduled learning. With the rapid advancement of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, there
    are significant opportunities to enhance such learning environments. The aim of this software
    engineering project is to explore and implement ways to effectively integrate GenAI into
    platforms like SEEK, enhancing the overall learning experience.
