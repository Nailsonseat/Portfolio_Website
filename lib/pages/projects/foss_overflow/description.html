    <p>
        Foss Overflow is a initiative by IIT Bhilai for developers to collaborate on open-source
        projects. It is
        designed to provide a supportive environment for developers who are new to the open source
        scene and help them to learn, grow, and contribute to the
        open-source community. Foss Overflow 2024 is the latest iteration of the event, and I was a
        part of a three member team that developed the amazing all in one Smart Insti App.

        The Smart Insti App is an all in one app for student and teachers alike. It provides a
        variety of features such as a Lost and Found, Room Vacancy, Chatrooms, Mess Menu.
        Making the everyday life of students and teachers easier. The repository and the app itself
        are made in such a way that it can be easily adapted and used by any institute with minor
        changes.
