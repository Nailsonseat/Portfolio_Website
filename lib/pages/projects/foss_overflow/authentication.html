<h1>Authentication</h1>
The Smart Insti App uses two types of authentication:
<ol>
    <li>Password Authentication</li>
    <p>
        The email-password authentication is exclusive to the Admin role and is used to authenticate
        the Admin.
        There is a separate page for admin login with proper validation and error handling.

             alt="Password Authentication">
    </p>
    <li>OTP Authentication</li>
    <p>
        The remaining two roles (Student and Faculty) use OTP authentication. The OTP is sent to the
        user's email.
        The user can then use the OTP to login to the app. The OTP is valid for 2 minutes. Using
        index to delete the OTP from the database after 2 minutes.
