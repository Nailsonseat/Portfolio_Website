                    <h3>Context Generation</h3>
                    There are times when you encounter a question during your test or exam that is unimpressive,
                    stale, and devoid of any creativity. This kind of question not only looks bad but their lack
                    of context and relatability doesn't help the students either. Therefore <b>Context
                    Generation</b> aims to introduce context to the question using GPT models at a click of a
                    button. Thus questions with context will make the assessment process that much more
                    enjoyable and help the students to better implement the learned concepts in the real
                    world.<br><br>

                    <h3>Template Randomizer</h3>
                    In a question the user has the option to mark variables in a question then they have the
                    option to mark some variables, so that when the question is published to students, the text
                    marked as variables are randomized. There are filters that can be applied on a variable so
                    that the randomness of a variable is in control of the user.<br><br>

                    <h3>Question segmentation</h3>
                    Well now that we have introduced context in our questions, it is apparent that the length of
                    questions has been significantly increased, that is going to be very hectic for the students
                    to read and interpret. Hence the questions can also be segmented into easy to digest smaller
                    parts.<br><br>

                    <h3>Question distribution</h3>
                    The teachers can create their own classrooms, they can distribute the questions in form of
                    assignments, tests, exams etc.<br><br>
