    <p>My most ambitious project ever.
        This app aims to reduce a teacher's time in non teaching activities, since only 19% of a
        teachers time is actually spent on teaching.
        The app provides a huge set of features to manipulate and create questions at the click of a
        button.
        This Cross platform application gets many birds with one stone, with it compatibility
        spanning over Windows, Mac, Linux,
        Web, IOS and Android.<br><br>
        Some of the main features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to make and manageable question banks.</li>
        <li>Randomized questions for each and every student for a specific question template.</li>
        <li>Randomized question sets for a group of students, the user has the choice to divide the
            question set/bank in any number of sets, even one set of questions per student.
        </li>
        <li>Uses GPT API to to generate, extend and segment questions on a click of a button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>These features will be discussed later in great detail.</p>
