    <h1>E-commerce Shopper's Behaviour Understanding using Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
        The "E-commerce Shopper's Behaviour Understanding" is my first Kaggle
        competition project that aims to predict whether a user is likely to buy a product on an
        e-commerce website based on a wide range of factors. This data-driven model leverages
        various machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and offer insights into their
        purchase intentions.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Description:</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset comprises several features that capture user interactions with the e-commerce
        website. The first six columns represent the number of visits and total duration spent on
        different pages, including HomePage, LandingPage, and ProductDescriptionPage. GoogleMetrics
        like Bounce Rate, Exit Rate, and Page Value provide crucial metrics indicating user
        engagement and behavior on the website. Additionally, seasonal attributes and various user
        demographics like OS, Search Engine, Zone, Customer Type, Gender, and more are used as
        self-explanatory variables to further understand customer behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithms and Techniques:</h2>
    <p>
        The project incorporates a wide range of machine learning classifiers to analyze and predict
        user behavior. The following algorithms have been utilized:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            KNN is used to classify users based on their similarity to others in the dataset. It
            predicts whether a user will buy a product by considering the behaviors of similar
            users.
        </p>
        <li><b>Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            SVM is applied to create a hyperplane that optimally separates users into purchase and
            non-purchase categories, maximizing the margin between the two classes.
        </p>
        <li><b>XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            XGBoost is a powerful boosting technique that creates an ensemble of weak learners to
            improve predictive accuracy.
        </p>
        <li><b>Decision Tree Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            Decision trees are used to create a hierarchical model that splits users based on the
            most influential features to make predictions.
        </p>
        <li><b>Random Forest Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            Random Forests are an ensemble method that leverages multiple decision trees to achieve
            better generalization and reduce overfitting.
        </p>
        <li><b>Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            MLP is a deep learning model that uses artificial neural networks to learn complex
            patterns in the data.
        </p>
        <li><b>Ensemble Learning:</b></li>
        <p>
            The project employs ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting to combine the
            predictions of multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness.
        </p>
        <li><b>Voting Classifier:</b></li>
        <p>
            In the final stage, a voting classifier is implemented, combining the outputs of three
            classifiers: Decision Tree Classifier, Bagged Decision Tree Classifier, and MLP
            Classifier. The voting classifier selects the most frequent class predicted by the
            individual models, leading to a robust and balanced prediction.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hyperparameter Tuning:</h2>
    <p>
        To optimize the performance of each classifier, hyperparameter tuning is conducted.
        Hyperparameter tuning involves searching for the best set of hyperparameters that maximize
        the model's predictive capabilities. Techniques like Grid Search or Random Search are
        employed to fine-tune the model parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
        The "E-commerce Shopper's Behaviour Understanding" project represents a
        significant step in analyzing customer behavior and predicting purchase decisions in the
        e-commerce domain. With the integration of various machine learning algorithms, ensemble
        techniques, and hyperparameter tuning, the model offers valuable insights to e-commerce
        businesses, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and enhance the shopping experience
        for their customers.
