    <h2>Correlation</h2>
    <p>Most correlation is observed between features dealing with the duration in which the visitor
        interacts or just says on a certain page. Also the number of times a page was visited.</p>

    <h2><br><br>Accuracy of all the models</h2>
    <p>
        So the top models in terms of accuracy here is the Decision Tree Classifier (CART) on
        Bagging
        Classifier and also is tuned for hyper-parameters. Voting classifier with has been fed three
        models - MLP classifier, CART Tuned, CART Tuned Bagged. I really had high hopes with the
        Voting classifier but it didn't perform as expected and came in the second place. The third
        place is tied with many classifiers.

<div>
    <h2><br><br>Precision of all the models</h2>
    <p>
        The precision seems low indicating more work to be done. If I had to go back and make some
        changes i would probably do some sampling so that the distribution is somewhat balanced and
        then run everything over again.

    <h2><br><br>Recall of all the models</h2>
    <p>
        SVM takes the lead on this. I think i could've added some more classifiers to the voting
        classifier.

<div>
    <h2><br><br>F1 of all the models</h2>
    <p>
        F1 score is the culmination for precision and recall, here the SVM takes the lead. But my
        final submission was done with the voting classifier.
