    This solution tries to accurately forecast the spatial distribution of biomass availability in the given
    region and select optimal location for all the assets in the supply chain i.e., preprocessing Depots and
    Bio-refineries , such that the supply chain is robust, while satisfying practical objectives and constraints.
