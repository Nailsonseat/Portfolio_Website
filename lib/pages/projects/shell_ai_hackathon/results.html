        During the the course of this hackathon, the majority of the time was actually taken by our
        end semester exams. Therefore we had to manage our time and basically finish our submission
        within one week whereas the entire hackathon was for 1 month. At the end we got the score of
        19/100 which was expected considering the time we had to work on the project. The winner has
        about 150+ submissions (Only latest submission was considered as final), and we could only
        do one.
        So why would I even make a page for this project? Well, it was a great learning experience
        and
        we got to learn a lot of new things. We got to learn about LSTM models, Clustering, how to
        forecast data etc.
        So at the end of the day, it was a great learning experience, regardless of the end result.
