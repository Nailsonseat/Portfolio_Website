    <h2>Landing Page</h2>
    <p>The landing page is a simple appbar with two buttons and add product and metrics. A simple
        grid builder to display the added products</p>

    <h2>Add Product</h2>
    <p>The add product page is divided into three parts, basically inputs for text, image, audio
        respectively</p>

    <h2>Loading Page</h2>
    <p>The loading page features amazing asynchronous magic behind the screens, I think this is the
        most amount of async and Future related code I have ever written.</p>

    <h2>Product Edit/Confirmation Page</h2>
    <p>As the generated content is prone to errors therefore we introduced a edit product page to
        correct and edit the product details before adding it to the list of products in the landing
        page.</p>

    <h2>Metrics</h2>
    <p>The metrics page is a simple page describing the average time taken to each input to
        process.</p>
