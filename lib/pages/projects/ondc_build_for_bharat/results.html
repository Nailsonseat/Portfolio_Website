    We were invited to the Google office Bangalore to present our solution to the judges. And
    eventually we were declared as the runner up of the hackathon. The experience was amazing and I
    learned a lot about the power of AI and how it can be used to solve real world problems. We were
    also awarded prizes and 100K USD worth of GCP credits.
