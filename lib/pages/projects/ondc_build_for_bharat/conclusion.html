    ONDC Build for Bharat hackathon was the first ever hackathon in which I have used generative AI
    to create a
    solution to a very real problem. Our team was able to create a solution that was able seamlessly
    list a product
    with unstructured data in Indic languages. The solution was able to process the data and list
    the product on
    the platform. We ere also able to introduce google sign in authentication to the prototype, make
    it responsive for mobile screen and also link it to the firestore database.
