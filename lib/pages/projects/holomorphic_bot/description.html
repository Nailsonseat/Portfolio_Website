        The Holomorphic Bot is an innovative and versatile tri-wheeler robot developed as part of
        the prestigious E Yantra 22-23 competition. Designed with movable limbs and wheels
        positioned 120 degrees apart, the Holomorphic Bot operates in a wide range of degrees of
        freedom, making it highly adaptable to diverse environments and tasks. The project leverages
        ROS Noetic Ninjemys and Gazebo, to enable seamless
        simulation and robust performance of the robot in real life scenarios.
