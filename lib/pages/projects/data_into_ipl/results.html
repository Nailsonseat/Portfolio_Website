    The whole competition was challenging as we had to predict scores of every match's power play
    scores just the day before the match. We were excitedly watching each and every match to see how
    our model was performing. While we were not able to win the first prize, we were able to secure
    first spot in one of the sub categories and secure us some merchandise.
