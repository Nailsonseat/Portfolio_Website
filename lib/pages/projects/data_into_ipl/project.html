    At first we started to search the data top to bottom and concluded that the team in which the
    player does not matter as the players change team every season depending on the auction for
    players, so we only focused on the player and the performance of the player in the match. We
    used the batter and bowler data to calculate performance of each batter and bowler in the
    matches. And we introduced generalization in the models to handle a batter and bowler who have
    never been paired in the history of IPL from 2007.

    We check the histogram for the frequency of the runs scored by the batters and bowlers in the
    dataset.

    We made a list of possible runs that can be scored by a batter and bowler in a delivery as
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Then we created a classifier model to predict the runs scored by a batter in
    a
    delivery and the multiply the run per delivery by 36 to get the total runs scored by the team in
    the power play.
