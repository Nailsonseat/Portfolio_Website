    This was the first solo passion project that I have ever done without looking any video online.
    I have learned a lot from this
    project. This was also the first time I learned about dynamic arrays called vectors and how to
    use them in C++. I used ASCII code to capture keyboard input to the point where I still remember
    some of the keyboard ASCII to this date as im writing this. This is also the first time I ever
    used the concept of modularity in my code. I have learned a lot from this project and it has
    helped me to become a better programmer.
