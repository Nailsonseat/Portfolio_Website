<h1>A brand new Menu</h1>
The original version didn't even have a menu. This is a brand new menu that I have created. It is a
simple menu with a few options. The menu is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>Start</li>
    <p>
        This is the main option. It is the option that the user will use to play the game. When the
        user clicks on this option, the game will start.
    </p>
    <li>Options</li>
    <p>
        This is the option that the user will use to change the settings of the game. When the user
        clicks on this option, the game will take the user to the options menu.
    </p>
    <li>Exit</li>
    <p>
        This is the option that the user will use to quit the game. When the user clicks on this
        option, the game will quit.
    </p>
</ol>

<h1>Options Section</h1>
The options section is where the user can change the appearance of the snake and the food. All of
these options are created using Unicode characters.
There are six appearance options for the snake and the food. The options are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>2 options for snake's body</li>
    <li>2 options for snake's head</li>
    <li>4 options for food</li>
    <li>4 options for food color</li>
    <li>7 options for snake's head color</li>
    <li>7 options for snake's body color</li>
</ul>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
The gameplay is simple. The user controls the snake using the arrow keys or WASD. The snake has to
eat the food to grow. The walls are not solid, so the snake can go through the walls and come out of
the other side.
The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
<br><br>
The coordinates of the snake and the food are stored in a list vector and its length is increased
everytime the snake eats the food.

The upper right corner of the screen shows the score of the player.
<br><br>
The focused frames per second basically means that the game doesn't loop the terminal on which the
game is displayed row or column wise, but just jumps to the coordinates straightaway. This is me
digging through the old discontinued conio.h header and making some adjustments to use it in the
game.
