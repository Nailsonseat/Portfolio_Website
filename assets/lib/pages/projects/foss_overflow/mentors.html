<h1>Henil Panchal</h1>

<p>Backend Developer at Fortran Programming Language with a proven track record in creating robust
    Python-based solutions. With a track record of optimizing websites and pioneering real-time
    frameworks</p>

<p>Henil really helped me with getting the backend setup right and provided really good suggestions
    regarding overall backend-frontend communication of the project. He also introduced me to the
    notion of of pagination / lazy loading which is when we provide limit/size and offset/page
    params
    along with the HTTP request specially in the listing GET methods for a particular resource so
    that the entire database is not returned and we only loading the part of the screen which is
    visible to the user.</p>


<h1>Akshat Tripathi</h1>

<p>A passionate Full Stack Android Developer with considerable Web Development and DevOps skills</p>

<p>Akshat suggested our team to use less packages as the project continues to scale up and get
    bigger PR by PR. He also suggested not a current problem but a problem that may arise in the
    future as the development of the app attain further progress. The problem highlighted was
    regarding the scalability of the app's state management which was being implemented using the
    Provider package at that time which does not scale very well with the growing size of the
    project. He then suggested to either migrate to Riverpod or Bloc state management which are more
    suited to projects of bigger size. So we decided to migrate to Riverpod as Provider and Riverpod
    were created by the same creator after all as the migration process would be faster and easier.
    It took additional 2 days to migrate to Riverpod but at the end looking back now our team is
    glad that we followed through with Akshat's suggestion.</p>

<h1>Aditya Vinay Dubey</h1>

<p>Aditya gave our team insights about the overall schema for the database. Initially our entire
    team's focus was to make the models and schema according to the features that we were trying to
    implement, but Aditya suggested many changes such which not only focused on current
    features in our joint proposal but also for the features which will be implemented in the
    future, which really prompted me to look the project with a bigger lens</p>

<h1>Tushar Bansal</h1>

<p>While Tushar was not a mentor but a maintainer for the project's repository. He was the one to
    suggest that we aim for a generalized repository which can be easily be used by any
    org/institute that wanted to use the app for themselves. I still remember a really good example
    that he gave about the Slack team communication app which by professional teams to collaborate
    on a
    project. He pointed that Slack does not maintain channels for organisations using the the app,
    but the organisations maintain the their own team channels under a template called Slack
    Channels on the app which I think was a very good example.</p>
