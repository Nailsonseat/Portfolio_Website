<h1>Authentication</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Login options</h3>
        At first, I was unsure about the login options I wanted in the app, then decided that an
        Anonymous login wasn't the way to go about this app, since many features here rely on
        working with an authenticated user one way or another. Hence finally after long hours of
        brainstorming, I decided on three options Google, Phone number, and Email. These
        options will be used to authenticate a user.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Old</th>
                <th>New</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/login_opt_old.png">
                </td>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/login_opt_new.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>OTP based Login</h3>
        The OTP based login is based on Google's api for SMS but the limitation is that the length
        of OTP is fixed to six.
        So therefore I have wrapped the otp boxes in a 'Wrap' widget.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Old</th>
                <th>New</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/number_input_old.png">
                </td>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/number_input_new.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/otp_page_old.png">
                </td>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/otp_page_new.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Email based Login</h3>
        EmailJs api is used to send email to send OTP, in this case I have also fixed the length of
        the OTP to six for consistency for the SMS based login.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Old</th>
                <th>New</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/email_old.png">
                </td>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/email_new.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/email_reg_old.png">
                </td>
                <td class="old-new">
                    <img class="demo-img" src="asset:lib/assets/images/project_images/acharya_setu/email_reg_new.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Google based Login</h3>
        The google based login was easy to implement with firebase on android and such, but for web
        i had to make some changes in the manifest file to properly implement the google login.<br><br>

    <li>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        The home page is just a dummy page with an expansion tile and hard-coded questions. So there
        is not
        much to look at here. It is just so that one can explore the search engine. So it is just
        for show for now.<br><br>
