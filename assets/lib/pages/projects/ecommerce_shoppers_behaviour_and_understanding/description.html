    <h1>E-commerce Shopper's Behaviour Understanding using Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
        The "E-commerce Shopper's Behaviour Understanding" is my first Kaggle
        competition project that aims to predict whether a user is likely to buy a product on an
        e-commerce website based on a wide range of factors. This data-driven model leverages
        various machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and offer insights into their
        purchase intentions.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Description:</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset comprises several features that capture user interactions with the e-commerce
        website. The first six columns represent the number of visits and total duration spent on
        different pages, including HomePage, LandingPage, and ProductDescriptionPage. GoogleMetrics
        like Bounce Rate, Exit Rate, and Page Value provide crucial metrics indicating user
        engagement and behavior on the website. Additionally, seasonal attributes and various user
        demographics like OS, Search Engine, Zone, Customer Type, Gender, and more are used as
        self-explanatory variables to further understand customer behavior.

    <p>
        The first six columns represent the different pages in the e-commerce website visited by a
        user from other sites.<br>

    <ul>
        <li>HomePage: Number of times visited this page.<br></li>
        <li>HomePage_Duration: Total number of duration spent on this page.<br></li>
        <li>LandingPage: Number of times visited this page.<br></li>
        <li>LandingPage_Duration: Total number of duration spent on this page.<br></li>
        <li>ProductDesriptionPage: Number of times visited this page.<br></li>
        <li>ProductDescriptionPage_Duration: Total number of duration spent on this page.<br></li>
        <li>GoogleMetric-Bounce Rate: Whenever a user comes to any one web-page of the website and
            he/she does not go to any other page and exits from the website from the same page, then
            this activity done by the user is called Bounce. And the percentage of the total number
            of times the user visiting our website and bounce it, is called Bounce Rate<br>
        </li>
        <li>GoogleMetric-Exit Rate: The bounce rate is calculated based on the user exiting a
            website after visiting one page. But some users exit from the second, third, fourth, or
            any other page of our website, then those visitors’ data help determine the exit rate.
            The percentage of the total number of times the user to our website who do not exit from
            the first page (Landing Page) but exit after exploring other website pages is called the
            Exit Rate.<br>
        </li>
        <li>GoogleMetric-Page Value: Page Value is the average value for a page that a user visited
            before landing on the goal page or completing an Ecommerce transaction.<br>
        </li>
        <li>SeasonalPurchase: It is a weight indicator to track the seasonal purchase. If a user
            makes a purchase during any seasonal time (Mother’s Day, Diwali, Valentine's Day), we
            will assign based on internal heuristic.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Month_SeasonalPurchase: Month of the special day considered for seasonal purchase.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    The other attributes like, OS, Search Engine, Zone, Type of Traffic, Customer Type, Gender,
    Cookies Setting, Education, Marital Status and Weekend Purchase are self-explanatory variables
