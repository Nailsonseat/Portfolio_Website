    Let’s try to understand the Waste-to-Energy problem using the map shown in Figure below. It
    corresponds to the yearly residual biomass available in the state of Gujarat in Western India.
    The geographic region is divided into equisised grid blocks, and the average biomass production
    of each grid block is represented on the color scale. The spatial distribution will change year
    after year, and the biomass available in these grid blocks will serve as feedstock to biofuel
    production Figure below showing Spatial residual biomass production plants i.e., biorefineries.
    The biomass
    feedstock needs to be optimally collected and transported to the biorefineries’ gate, and the
    grid blocks in Figure below i.e., the Harvesting Sites serve as the starting point in the supply
    chain. At each Harvesting Site , biomass availability can be forecasted using historical data.
    External parameters such as weather, rainfall, government regulation etc. may also influence the
    biomass production.

    Bales of biomass will be collected from these Harvesting Sites and
    transported to the pre-processing Depots for densification and pelletisation. The pellets will
    then be transported from each of these Depots to each Biorefinery, in quantities that cater to
    each Biorefinery’s demand. The locations of the Depot and the Biorefinery will remain constant.

    We were able to take the first step towards solving this problem by forecasting by the data
    provided to us and apply LSTM model to forecast the biomass availability in the given region.

    We also tried to select the optimal location for all the assets in the supply chain i.e.,
    preprocessing Depots and Bio-refineries, such that the supply chain is robust, while satisfying
    practical objectives and constraints.
