    <h1>Predictive Model for IPL Power Play Score</h1>
    <p>
        The Predictive Model for IPL Power Play Score is a data-driven solution that uses
        scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib's pyplot, and pandas to predict the number of runs scored by
        a team during the first 6 overs of an IPL match, also known as the power play. This model is
        a part of a research initiative at IIT Madras to analyze the data from the IPL competition
        since its inception in 2008. The model is designed to provide valuable insights into team
        performance and help cricket enthusiasts make informed predictions.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
        The model is built using two datasets:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Ball by Ball Dataset:</strong> This dataset contains detailed information about
            individual deliveries in each match, including features like innings, overs, ball
            number, batter, bowler, extras, runs scored, wickets, and other relevant data. The
            dataset is used to understand the dynamics of each delivery and its impact on the team's
            performance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Matches Result Dataset:</strong> This dataset provides comprehensive
            match-related information, such as the city, date, season, teams competing, venue, toss
            details, winning team, margin of victory, and players of the match. It helps in
            analyzing the overall match outcomes and understanding the context of each match.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Model Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The predictive model utilizes various machine learning techniques provided by scikit-learn
        to perform both classification and regression tasks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Classification:</strong> This approach assumes that the runs scored by a batsman
            fall in the range [0,8] and thus produces label in this range and then averages the runs
            that the team may score in the first 36 balls of the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Regression:</strong> This approach tries to calculate the average run that the
            batsman will score per ball, and then spans it for 36 balls.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to model training, the datasets are cleaned and preprocessed using pandas to handle
        missing values, convert categorical variables into numerical representations, and perform
        feature engineering to extract valuable insights from the data. The processed data is then
        split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
    </p>
    <h2>Model Evaluation and Visualization</h2>
    <p>
        The predictive model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and
        other relevant measures. Matplotlib's pyplot is employed to visualize the results,
        displaying the predicted power play scores and match outcomes, as well as comparing them
        with actual results to assess the model's accuracy.
