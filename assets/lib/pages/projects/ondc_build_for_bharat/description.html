    <h1>ONDC Build for Bharat</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a government initiative to create a unified
        digital commerce platform for the country. The platform aims to provide a level playing
        field for all participants in the digital commerce ecosystem, including buyers, sellers, and
        service providers. The ONDC platform will enable small and medium businesses to reach a
        wider audience and compete with larger players in the market. It will also provide consumers
        with a wide range of choices and a seamless shopping experience.

    <h2>Aim</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of the ONDC Build for Bharat hackathon is to develop a innovative solution that will
        be able to help shop owners to list their products or entire catalogues on the ONDC platform
        so that those products can be discovered by a wider audience irrespective of the seller app
        or website. The solution should be able to help the shop owners to manage their inventory,
        orders, and payments in a seamless manner.

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that leverage cutting-edge technologies to
        seamlessly digitalize and enhance product catalogs, offering a user-friendly experience for
        sellers and seller apps.
        Consider a sample catalog with at least 1000 SKUs, with attributes such as SKU id, product
        name, description, price, image, inventory, colour, size, brand, etc.
        This catalog is to be digitized using a combination of intuitive interfaces such as text /
        voice / image input, with text & voice input using any of the Indic languages.
        In some cases, a combination of these interfaces are required to digitize an SKU e.g. scan
        image which pre-fills the product name from the repository, with the remaining attributes
        filled using text or voice input.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Solution Expected & Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
        Showcase a solution that allows catalog digitization using a combination of interfaces as
        explained above. Provide a mechanism to measure the throughput of digitization (for e.g x
        number of catalog digitisation in one day).
        All artefact used should be elaborated.
        All assumptions should be elaborated.
